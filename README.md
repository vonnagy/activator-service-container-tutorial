Service Container
===========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vonnagy/activator-service-container-tutorial.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vonnagy/activator-service-container-tutorial)

# Overview
This is a Typesafe Activator Template for demonstrating how to build a microservice using the
[Service Container](https://github.com/vonnagy/service-container). The example contained within the template constructs
a simple REST API for the CRUD operation of a Widget. It simulates the persistence layer, but can easily be replaced with your favorite bit of technology.

For detailed information please refer to the documentation in the [Tutorial](tutorial/index.md)
